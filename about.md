## About
Trigger Visualizer improves readability and visual clarity in the editor by updating textures for multiple trigger types.

Originally focused on shader triggers, the mod now also supports other default trigger categories, including:

- <cb>Shader triggers</c>
- <cy>Gameplay triggers</c>
- <cr>Area triggers</c>
- <cp>Logical triggers</c>
- <cc>Cameras triggers</c>

In addition, the mod introduces **dynamic texture updates** for:

- SFX triggers — textures change depending on their volume.
- Event triggers — textures change based on their event settings.

These updates make different trigger types easier to identify and manage, especially in complex setups.

---

## Customization
In <cg>this mod’s settings</c>, you can:

- Enable or disable texture changes for specific trigger categories.
- Enable or disable **dynamic texture updates** for <cm>SFX</c> and <ce>Event</c> triggers.
- Set a **volume threshold** for SFX triggers to control when their textures change.

This lets you keep the default look for certain triggers while still using custom or dynamic visuals for others.

## Notes
- This mod only affects the **editor**.
- Gameplay behavior of triggers is not modified.
